## Change The Server Access

&#x20;Edit the project-bo4.json if you want to change the access ip to limit people connecting to the webpannel.

```
"httpserver": {
    "access_ip": "0.0.0.0"
}
```

Replace `"0.0.0.0"` or whatever value you have with the IP address you only want to be able to access the webserver. (Leaving it `"0.0.0.0"` - will allow anyone to access the webserver with your ip:8080 ) To know your IP address, you can use this website: [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/), only you will be able to connect to the webpanel.
