The webpanel can be opened at the address [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).&#x20; (default adress for the host)

**NB:** If you are on a VPS, you need to have forward the TCP port 8080 to access the webserver on another network.&#x20;

Otherwise view it here [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)..
