# Server Emulator

> What is this used for ?

This is used to host a private server so that trusted people can connect to you. It is managed by a webpanel.

> What Languages are Supported ?

All the languages the base game supports. (The server will download requiered files when a player connects).

> Can i play using `Radmin VPN` or `Zero tier`.

[Yes](server-setup/radmin-vpn-guide.md"mention").

> What can't it do? What are the issues ?

For now, a few issues are known,

* It can't host multiple instances of the same lobby.

_Example_: you can have one lobby with Blood of the Dead, one lobby with IX, but not 2 lobbies with Blood the dead.

* It can't automatically disband a lobby after you're done playing, you need to disband the lobby manually on the webpanel.
* Stats and unlocks dont work properly.
