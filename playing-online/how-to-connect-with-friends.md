# How To Connect With Friends

**Only** the player that wants to be host should search a public game.

Do no search a lobby at the same time as your friends

Once the lobby has been created the other players can search for the public game, as seen in the red square wait for it to say waiting for players.

### Things To Consider.

* Host should preferably have an Open NAT type.
* You can't host multiple instances of the same lobby.

_Example_: you can have one lobby with Blood of the Dead, one lobby with IX, but not 2 lobbies with Blood the dead.

* It can't automatically disband a lobby after use, you need to disband the lobby manually on the [webpanel](server-setup/server-webpanel.md%22mention%22).
