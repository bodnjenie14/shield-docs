# How To Connect With Friends

### How to host a game with multiple players

**Only** the player that wants to be host should search a public game.

Once the lobby has been created, the other players can search for the public game.

## Things To Consider.

* Host should have the better nat type
* You can't host multiple instances of the same lobby.

_Example_: you can have one lobby with Blood of the Dead, one lobby with IX, but not 2 lobbies with Blood the dead.

* It can't automatically disband a lobby after use, you need to disband the lobby manually on the webpanel.
